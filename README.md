_status: alpha, breaking changes unlikely but possible_

```clojure 
[com.wotbrew/relic "0.1.2"]
```

`relic` is an experimental Clojure/Script in-memory database and data processing library.

Built in a lockdown induced _strange mood_, the goal is a clojure flavoured version of the functional relational programming model described by the [tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) paper.

## Why

When working on boring $business_problems, too much energy is spent on the machine like bits of programs,
data structures, threading the data to where it is needed, layout, ordering, access path etc.

I would prefer to focus more on the data itself, and the relationships between the data.

Industrial SQL databases seem to solve machine like problems by providing planners and optimisers, and ultimately making decisions on behalf of the programmer such that the programmer can get their work done and go home at 5pm.

`relic` can take care of many of the machine like bits of data query & processing, just as databases do.

- Fully featured in-memory database with indexed SQL style [query](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/query).
- Integrated and embedded in clojure, use clojure [functions](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/expr) in queries, build queries with clojure.
- [Materialized views](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/materialization) with incremental maintenance.
- Make invalid states illegal with [constraints](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/constraints).
- [Reactive](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/change-tracking), allowing efficient integration with react, bind components to materialized queries and remain responsive at 60fps.

relic is about in-memory clojure integrated relational programming, for this kind of thing at scale consider: [materialize](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize)

## Pitch

Do you suffer from _map fatigue_? [[1]](http://timothypratley.blogspot.com/2019/01/meander-answer-to-map-fatigue.html)

![despair](doc/tar2.png)

Did you try [meander](https://github.com/noprompt/meander), [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic), [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) and every graph-map-database under the sun but still do not feel [out of the tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)?

Are you tired of writing mechanical wiring and glue? That has *nothing* to do with your actual business logic?

`relic` might help, but it's not a medical professional. It's a functional relational programming library.

Definitely not at all like the other in-memory databases in clojure. This time its different, really.

## Brief tour

I like to use `rel` as an alias.

```clojure
(require '[com.wotbrew.relic :as rel])
```

This is a query, lets find some bob's.

```clojure 
 [[:from :Customer]
  [:where [= :name "bob"]]]
 ```

You can refine queries by just adding elements to the vector.  All your favorites are here, filtering (`:where`), computing columns (`:extend`), joins (`:join` & `:left-join`), grouping and aggregation (`:agg`) and more.

```clojure 
[[:from :Customer]
 [:where [= :name "bob"]]
 [:extend [:greeting [str "Hello, " :name "!"]]]
```

Because queries are just vectors, they just sort of lounge around being values. To put them to work we have to feed some data into relic.

`relic` databases are boring clojure maps. Prepare yourself:

```clojure 
(def db {})
```

See, boring.

You manipulate your database with the [`transact`](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/transact) function. This returns a new database with the transaction applied. Plain old functional programming, no surprises.
```clojure 
(def db (rel/transact {} [:insert :Customer {:name "bob"} {:name "alice"}])

db 
;; =>
{:Customer #{{:name "bob"}, {:name "alice"}}}
```

Now we have some state, we can ask questions of relic, as you would a SQL database.

```clojure 
(rel/q db :Customer)
;; => 
({:name "bob"}, {:name "alice"})

(rel/q db [[:from :Customer] [:where [= :name "bob"]]]) 
;; => 
({:name "bob"})

(rel/q db [[:from :Customer] [:agg [] [:avg-name-len [rel/avg [count :name]]]]])
;; => 
({:avg-name-len 4})
```

Ok ok, neat but not _cool_.

Ahhhh... but you don't understand, `relic` doesn't just evaluate queries like some kind of cave man technology - it is powered by a __data flow graph__.
`relic` knows when your data changes, and it knows how to modify dependent relations in a smart way.

You can materialize any query such that it will be maintained for you as you modify the database. In other words `relic` has __incremental materialized views__.

```clojure 
(rel/mat db [[:from :Customer] [:where [= :name "bob"]]])
;; => returns the database, its value will be the same (hint: metadata).
{:Customer #{{:name "bob"}, {:name "alice"}}}
```

`mat` will return a new _database_, against which materialized queries will be instant, and __as you change data in tables, those changes will flow to materialized queries automatically.__

You can do more than query and materialize with relic, you can [react to changes](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/change-tracking), use [constraints](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/constraints) and [more](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic).

If you read the tarpit paper, you might find this [real estate example](https://github.com/wotbrew/relic/blob/master/dev/examples/real_estate.clj) informative.
